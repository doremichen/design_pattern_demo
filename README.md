# Android Design Pattern Demo App

This Android application is created to demonstrate all **23 design patterns** from the Gang of Four (GoF) using practical and interactive examples.

Each design pattern is implemented as an individual module or screen, allowing users to understand not only the pattern structure, but also how it can be applied in a real Android development context.

## Purpose

- Provide a **visual and hands-on learning tool** for developers to master design patterns.
- Showcase **Java-based implementations** of the 23 classic GoF design patterns.
- Apply patterns in a way that fits Android architecture and UI components.

## Technologies Used

- **Platform**: Android
- **Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Android Studio
- **Minimum SDK**: 30 (Android 11)
- **Target SDK**: 35 (Android 14)

## Design Patterns Covered

The app demonstrates the following 23 design patterns categorized into 3 groups:

### Creational Patterns
- Singleton
- Factory Method
- Abstract Factory
- Builder
- Prototype

### Structural Patterns
- Adapter
- Bridge
- Composite
- Decorator
- Facade
- Flyweight
- Proxy

### Behavioral Patterns
- Chain of Responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Memento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
- Visitor

## How It Works

- The app starts with a demo design pattern list
- Each design pattern has a dedicated demo activity or fragment.
- Demos are designed to reflect real Android scenarios using Views, Activities, ListViews, RecyclerViews, and more.
- Pattern explanation and output logs are displayed on screen for clarity.

## How to Build

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-pattern-demo-android.git
2. Open with Android Studio.

3. Sync Gradle and build the project.

4. Run on an emulator or real device (SDK 30+ required).
